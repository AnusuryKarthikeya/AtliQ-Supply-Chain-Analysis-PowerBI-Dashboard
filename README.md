# 🛒 AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analysis

As part of the **Codebasics Data Analysis Practice Problem**, I performed data analysis and designed an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to analyze the supply chain service levels of AtliQ Mart.

## 📌 **Problem Statement**

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, currently operational in **Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara**. They plan to expand to other metro and Tier 1 cities in the next two years.

However, a few key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to service issues. Some essential products were either **not delivered on time** or **not delivered in full** consistently, leading to poor customer experience.

The management wants to resolve this before expansion and requested the supply chain analytics team to track **' On Time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels daily** to respond swiftly to issues.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Measure the following metrics against target service levels for each customer:

- **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**
- **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**

---

## ✅ **My Role & Tasks**

Assuming myself as a data analyst in the supply chain team, I:

- Created the required metrics as per stakeholder requirements.
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators.
- Derived additional insights beyond requested metrics to support strategic decisions.

## 🔍 **Key Insights**

- All key metrics (**OT%, IF%, OTIF%**) are far behind their targets.
- **Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores** have the highest order volumes and also the most delayed deliveries.
- Ghee, curd, and butter products are the most delayed categories for delivery.
- There has been **no noticeable improvement** in key metrics in recent months.
- Significant gaps in **IF% for most customers**, raising questions about underproduction or demand planning accuracy.
